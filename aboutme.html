    I am proud to say that I recently graduated from both Passaic County Technical Institute and Yoga Renew. This was no easy feat, and it required a lot of hard work and dedication. I now work for the County of Passaic, and I am employed at Preakness Healthcare Center. This is an incredible accomplishment and I am excited to open many doors for myself in the future. I am so proud of all of my achievements and look forward to continuing to grow and develop my skills.
